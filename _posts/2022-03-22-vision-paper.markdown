The paper [Binocular mirrorâ€“symmetric microsaccadic sampling enables Drosophila hyperacute 3D vision][vision-paper] is now online on the PNAS website!

For my third-year dissertation I was lucky enough to work in the Juusola lab at the University of Sheffield. My project involved measuring the deep pseudopupil movements of mutant flies using a rather unusual microscope set up. The project was a lot of fun, and a little of my data contributed towards this exciting publication!

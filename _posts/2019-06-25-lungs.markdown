A video I worked on is out.

One of the most fun projects I've worked on during my degree is out. In a small group we made a [little educational video about the lungs][lung]. I did most of the video editing and animation, and had a great time doing it. It's cool to break up the constant essays and questions with a project at University which is creative and different!

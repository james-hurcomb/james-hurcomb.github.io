Hi, Iâ€™m James. I'm a PhD student in toxicology, studying how drugs and environmental pollutants affect how organs in the body communicate. My research focuses on whole-body coordination of metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction using *Drosophila* as a model system.

Feel free to [read more about me][about], [look at my CV][cv], or take a look below to see some of the things I've been up to recently.

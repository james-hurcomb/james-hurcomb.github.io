I'm James. I'm interested in toxicology, mitochondria, fruit flies, and any and all interesting new problems!

I grew up in the South of England, before moving to Sheffield to study for an MBiomedSci degre in Biomedical Science at the University of Sheffield. I had four fun years learning about anatomy, pharmacology, molecular biology, and the beauty of the peak district. While in Sheffield I was also introduced to the wonders of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, working in the labs of [Andrew Lin][andrew] and [Mikko Juusola][mikko] for undergraduate projects. Following this, I wrote a master's thesis on novel memory paradigms for testing zebrafish vision and learning with Anton Nikolaev.

Missing fruit flies, I moved to the MRC Toxicology Unit at the University of Cambridge in 2021. I work in the group of [Miguel Martins][miguel] where we investigate molecular initiating events and downstream pathways of toxicity mediated by the mitochondria. I use the fruit fly to model mitochondrial dysfunction. I'm particularly interested in the gastrointestinal side-effects of drugs and environmental toxins, and how organs in the body integrate a response to local insults in the gut and liver. You can view [my profile on the MRC Toxicology website][me-mrc] to hear more about what I do there.

I've [contributed to a few published research papers][me-google-scholar]. You can also read more approachable writing of mine on the [BlueSci website][bs].
